[**fuccboiGDX**](http://fuccboi.moe/) is a 2D game making code-centric engine/framework that provides additional higher level functionalities on top of [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org/), making game creation easier, faster, and buzzword! It’s free, open source and supported on Windows, Linux and OSX.

## Tutorials

Tutorials are divided in four sections: beginner, intermediate, advanced and examples. The order the tutorials are written in are examples > advanced >>> beginner > intermediate; so if you came here and there are no beginner/intermediate tutorials then it means I haven't gotten to it yet.

### Beginner

The **beginner** section has a bunch of tutorials for people who have never programmed before and want to get started. The topics covered range from the very basics of programming up to right before object orientation is needed. 

### Intermediate

The **intermediate** section is for people who already have some programming experience (and for people who went through the beginner tutorials) but don't necessarily know Lua, LÖVE nor game programming enough. The topics covered range from a bottom up explanation of object oriented programming to making newbie-friendly games such as Pong, Asteroids, Arkanoid, Tetris and so on. 

### Advanced

The **advanced** section is for people who are already experienced game programmers in other engines/frameworks and who simply want to learn how to use fuccboiGDX. The tutorials here are games that vary on complexity, but all have the main goal of showcasing different uses of the engine as well as recommended best practices.

### Examples

The **examples** section simply has a lot of short examples on how to do X or Y. It's supposed to serve as a fast way of checking how to do some action without having to look at the full documentation, for people who are more example driven.
